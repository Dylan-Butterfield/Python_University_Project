# Python Programming for Real World Data Analytics and GUI Development
## Tasks and Actions
- Analysis of low cost environmental sensor dataset.

- Uncover insights into room occupancy count.

- Use machine learning algorithms to predict room occupancy count.

- Import, transform and analyse dataset, find accuracy and F1-scores of ML functions and create visualisations to explain relationships.

- Develop GUI for end user to explore the dataset.

## Results
- Received a high distinction for the project.

- Created subtables to obtain exact times of maximum and minimum readings.

- Compared ML outputs to values provided in literature.

- Created visualisations to uncover insights and relationships.

- Created GUI for user to interact with the dataset.
